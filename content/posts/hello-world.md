My earliest gaming memory is sitting on my Dad's lap at 4 or 5 years old, firing the shotgun in DOOM while he handled the movement. Even at that age it dawned on me that the monitor was a window into another world...

When I was 9 or 10, my Dad asked me what I thought I might want to do when I was older, and without much thought, I told him I wanted to make computer games. When it came time to think about University, I remembered that conversation, said fuck it, and applied to study Computer Science with a specialisation in games at the University of Brighton.

After graduating with a 2:1, a £2k overdraft, £25k in student loan debt and a strong desire to get drunk and make music with my friends, I got my first job as a junior web developer at a tiny start up in Brighton, UK. That was 13 years ago, and I'm still working in the same industry as a Software Architect.

I'm sad to say, I've barely written a line of C++ since Uni. That mostly stems from fear I think. I have and always have had a genuine desire to create things for myself and for others, but I also fear failure and greater than that, I also fear success. I don't think this is uncommon, it's very typical of Millennials.

Over the years, my skills as a programmer have really come along. Outside of work, I've hard-committed to numerous creative hobbies at various junctures in my life: music production, martial arts, poker, cooking and songwriting to name a few. I finally feel confident enough in my abilities as both a problem solver and a creative to take the plunge and chase the original dream, to build virtual worlds.

I'm starting this devlog to document that journey. My long-term goal is ambitious but clear: to write and release my own indie game. In the short term, I plan to study the work of the early pioneers and sharpen my C++ whilst doing so, diving deep into programming concepts, game engines, design principles, and probably some maths I should have paid more attention to at Uni.

I'll be documenting everything along the way. The experiments and toy projects, programming concepts as I learn them, design decisions and why they worked (or didn't), tools and resources that actually help, and inevitably, the mistakes and dead ends (probably a lot of these).

I guess you could say this is my hello world moment for game development.

Let's see where I end up.
