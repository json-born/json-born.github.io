At 33, I've spent the last 12 years building a solid foundation in full-stack web development, crafting everything from responsive frontends to scalable backend architectures. My computer science degree specialized in games development, but life had other plans – I found myself drawn into the rapidly evolving world of web technologies, where I've honed my skills across JavaScript, React, Node.js, databases, and cloud platforms.

Over the years, I've grown confident in my ability to architect solutions, debug complex systems, and deliver robust applications under pressure. I've seen frameworks rise and fall, witnessed the evolution from jQuery spaghetti to modern component-based architectures, and navigated the endless parade of new tools and methodologies that define our industry. This experience has taught me not just how to code, but how to think systematically about problems and build maintainable, scalable solutions.

But here's the thing – while I've been building web applications, there's always been this persistent voice in the back of my head whispering about game development. Those late nights spent optimizing database queries or wrestling with asynchronous JavaScript? I'd find myself wondering how Carmack optimized his rendering loops, or how modern engines handle thousands of entities without breaking a sweat. I've always dreamt of making games, but never actually committed to learning properly.

The technical skills I've developed aren't just transferable to game development – they're foundational. Understanding memory management, performance optimization, state management, and complex system interactions gives me a head start that I didn't have fresh out of university. The difference now is confidence. I know I can learn new technologies, adapt to different paradigms, and push through the inevitable frustrations that come with mastering something new.

This isn't about abandoning web development – it's about finally pursuing the creative and technical challenge I've been postponing for over a decade. I want to build worlds, not just websites. I want to solve the unique problems that come with real-time rendering, physics simulation, and creating engaging interactive experiences. Most importantly, I want to prove to myself that it's never too late to chase the dream that got me into programming in the first place.

So I'm starting this devlog to document the journey. My long-term goal is ambitious but clear: to write and release my own indie game. In the short term, I plan to study the work of the early pioneers and learn C++ whilst doing so – diving deep into programming concepts, game engines, design principles, and probably some maths I should have paid more attention to in school.

I'll be documenting everything along the way – the experiments and toy projects, programming concepts as I learn them, design decisions and why they worked (or didn't), tools and resources that actually help, and inevitably, the mistakes and dead ends (probably lots of these). There's no timeline pressure here, just learning, building, and figuring things out one step at a time.

This is my hello world moment for game development. Let's see where this journey takes us.
