      <description>&lt;p&gt;At 33, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last 12 years building a solid foundation in full-stack web development, crafting everything from responsive frontends to scalable backend architectures. My computer science degree specialized in games development, but life had other plans â€“ I found myself drawn into the rapidly evolving world of web technologies, where I&amp;rsquo;ve honed my skills across JavaScript, React, Node.js, databases, and cloud platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve grown confident in my ability to architect solutions, debug complex systems, and deliver robust applications under pressure. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen frameworks rise and fall, witnessed the evolution from jQuery spaghetti to modern component-based architectures, and navigated the endless parade of new tools and methodologies that define our industry. This experience has taught me not just how to code, but how to think systematically about problems and build maintainable, scalable solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
